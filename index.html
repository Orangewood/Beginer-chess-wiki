    <p>Chess is a two player board game that is belived to be derived from the 7th century Indian game chaturanga. The current rules of chess that is played in tournaments, over-the-board and  online play dates back from 15th century Spain. The game requires strategy, tactical calculation, foresight, patience and thoughtfulness. For these reasons, chess has built a reputation that has evolved historically and often seen its place as a game of class, skill, intelect and national pride. Today chess is estimated to be played by hundreds of millions of people world wide, spanning over 150 countires.   </p>
    <p> There are various methods of calculating skill in chess. The most accepted rating in chess is the Elo system, which the international chess federation (FIDE) uses as a benchmark to gauge a players strength. With the rise of computer engines, professional human playing strength in chess has seen an incline over the past 40 years. Interestingly, chess Elo can be compared from players of the past to the present, in search of the greatest of all time; although this omits the contribution and advantage of computer analysis.

      <p> 
        A chess board is comprised 64 squares fashioned in an 8x8 setting, with 32 white and 32 black squares. It is almost identical to a checker board, with red being replaced by white. Additionally, each square is labeled as a coordinate with rows and columns given an algebraic syntax as shown:

    <section class ="main-section" id="The_Pieces">
      <header>The Pieces</header>
      <p>Each color is given 16 pieces comprised of: 8 pawns, 2 knights, 2 bishops, 2 rooks, 1 queen and 1 king. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>The pawn</h4>
      <p> At the start of the game there are 8 pawns per side. As being the majority piece on the board, it naturally has less of a value than other pieces. As the game progresses the pawns have the potential to become as valuable as minor and major pieces through its ability of promotion.</p>
      <ul>
        <li> The pawn moves one space forward, and captures diagonally by one space. </li><br>
        <li> Any pawn can elect to move two squares forward, instead of one on its initial move, but retains the one move rule after this. </li><br>
        <li> Once the pawn has reached the opponents back rank, or 8th row, it has the option to promote to any piece other than a king or another pawn. </li><br>
        <li> The pawn can capture by a special move called "en passant"</li><br>
      </ul>

    <br>
          <h4> The knight </h4>
          <p> The knight is the only piece that has the ability to "leap" over pieces that are impeding its movement. The knight maneuvers in a peculiar manner compared to the other pieces. Its value is commonly regarded as worth three pawns, and is deemed a minor piece.  </p>
            <ul>
          <li> Knights move and capture in an L-shape, with two sqares in either a horizontal or vertical direction, and then one square horizontally or vertically after that.</li><br>
          <li> Knights are the only piece that can deliver a unique checkmate pattern called a "smothered mate"</li><br>
          </ul>

          <br>
          <h4> The bishop</h4>
          <p>
            The pair of bishops occupy both the white and black squares for each side. These are commonly called the dark squared and light squared bishops. Along with the knight, the bishop is a minor piece but is generally slighly stronger, and worth 3.5 pawns.</p>
            <ul>
            <li> The bishop moves and captures diagonally along its home color.</li> <br>
    </ul>

          <h4>The rook</h4>
          <p>
            The rook is considered a major piece as it has the ability to pressure more squares than the knight and bishop. The value of the rook is regarded as 5 pawns.</p>
            <ul>
            <li> The rook moves and captures in either a horizontal or a vertical movement.</li><br>
            <li>The rook resembles a castle, which is incidentally the name of a special maneuver we will discuss later.</li><br>

          <h4>The queen </h4>
          <p>
The queen is the strongest major piece in the game being regarded as 8 pawns worth. </p>
            <ul>
            <li>The queen captures and moves in any direction, such as a cominbation of the rook, bishop and king.</li><br>
            <li> The queen is often a secondary target for strategy throughout the game when the king is fully protected</li>

          <h4>The king</h4>
          <p>
            The king is the major piece that must be captured in order to win the game. This is called checkmate. When an opponents piece is attacking the king, it is in "check", and must either move, or the attacking piece can be blocked or captured by another piece. The king has no pawn value as the game revolves around its survivability. </p>
            <ul>
            <li> The king moves and captures in any direction by one square.</li><br>
            <li>The king cannont put itself into the scope of another attacking piece, as this is an illegal move, or commonly referred as "moving into check"</li><br>

      <p>
        There are two special moves in chess: en passant and castling. Castling is when the king and its respective rook have not moved, the pieces in between have been evacuated from the row, and the king can not pass through a check, it may castle. The two types of castle are known as queen side castle or king side castle.</p>

      <br>
      <p>The capture of enpassant is done when a pawn elects to move two spaces, and thus avoids capture by surpassing the opponents pawn's ability to take, and can thus take diagonally as shown:

      <header> Strategy</header>
      <p> As noted previously, the object of chess is to capture your opponents king. When a king is checkmated, this is when the king has no squares to escape to and on the next move will be captured. There are three pieces that can deliver a checkmate on their own: The queen, rook and knight. Throughout a chess match players coordinate all their pieces to achieve this goal, and hence win the game. There are occasions when players do not win nor lose, which is called a draw. A draw is either agreed upon by repition of moves, or a "stalemate" which occurs when a player has no legal moves to make and is not in check.</p>
      
      <p>Chess matches consitute three different stages of the game: the begining, the middle game, and the end game. Each of these sections of the game are heavily strategized and require study or analysis in game. Chess theory is primarily based on the opening game, which later transitions in advantages that gives players a "winning position". For more information regarding the begining game, click <a href="https://www.chess.com/openings"> here </a> for chess openings.
       </p>
      <p>
        The middle game is the part of chess where most tactics occur. The complexities of chess is usually most notable during this stage of the game. With each move that is made in the middle game, the end game is defined by such play. Advantages and opportunity will normally begin to materialize during this stage. Tactical play is abundant and strategy is crafted to reach the coveted checkmate. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The end game is objectively the most important stage of the game. It is during this stage that the decisive result will be created. It is normal that the end game has seen a majority of pieces traded off. Although the end game is not always reached as mate can be delivered much earlier, it is commonplace that the studying the end game advances a players skill significantly.

        The current state of chess is ever evoling with the advancement of computer computation power and artificial inteligence. The progress of computer AI has seen its impact in professional chess theory currently. The "book" lines of chess openings and theory are being re-written with every new engine that is developed. Currently, the strongest chess engine is AlphaZero developed by Google, and Stockfish 11. Aside from computer developement and chess, professional chess is very active. The current rank one player is Magnus Carlsen from Norway who has achieved the highest Elo rating achieved by a human of 2882. In contrast, AlphaZero's Elo rating is estimated around 3500+!
